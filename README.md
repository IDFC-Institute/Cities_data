MAPPING INDIA'S URBANISATION (Urban Growth of Indian Cities)
============================================================

Cities covered: Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and
Ahmedabad.

Folder contains data on: Built-up, Population,Ward Boundaries,Nightlights (Visible Infrared 
Imaging Radiometer Suite) and Infrastructure (Highways, Metro, Mono and Local 
rail line) layers

Temporal resolution: Built-up: 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2014; Population: 1975,
1990, 2000 and 2015 and VIIRS: 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015

Spatial resolution: Built-up: 38 meter; Population: 250 meter and VIIRS: 463.05
meter

Dataset sources:

1. GHSL - The Global Human Settlement (GHS) framework produces global spatial
information about the human presence on the planet over time. The spatial data
here shows the distribution of built-up area and population for four time
periods: 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2014. The built-up and population layer data has
been extracted from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), see [link](http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) for more
information.

2. VIIRS - Earth Observations Group (EOG) at NOAA/NGDC is producing a version 1 VIIRS suite of average radiance composite images using nighttime data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB). See [link](https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_dnb_composites.html) for more information.  

File format: The zip file contains Built-up, Population, Infrastructure,
Municipal boundary and Ward Boundaries in Shapefile, KML and Geojson formats and VIIRS in Geotiff
format.
